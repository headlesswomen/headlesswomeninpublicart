                <p class="paragraphs"> The Headless Women do not listen, do not speak, do not cry. Do they have brains? Have they lost their minds?<br/>
                        They have no neck, no eyes, no ears, no mouth. Do they have a voice?<br/>
                        They do not wear earrings. They have no ears. No glasses. No necklace. Do they have clothes?<br/>
                        The Headless women have hair and have holes. Sometimes they have arms and sometimes they also have got legs. Can they run away?<br/>
                        The Headless Women stay close to the ground.<br/>
                        They have a butt, a belly and breasts. Do you have a vagina?<br/>
                        The Headless Women are made of stone, paper, wood, clay, and even flesh and blood.<br/>
                        Are they art?<br/>
                        Do they have a name?<br/> 
                        Do the Headless Women want a head? Whose head? Or rather, a head of what? </p>

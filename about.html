                      They do not wear earrings. They have no ears. No glasses. No necklace. Do they have clothes?<br/>
                      The Headless women have hair and have holes. Sometimes they have arms and sometimes they also have got legs. Can they run away?<br/>

                      They have a butt, a belly and breasts. Do you have a vagina?<br/>

                    <p class="aboutparagraphs">The map of Headless Women in Public Art is part of the <b>Headless Women and Other Events</b> – 
                      a wider art and design project created by Mariana Morais which examines Public Art through women’s lens. 
                        This project aims to identify, reorganize, reflect and spatialize narratives related to Women. 
                        It promotes a diversification of histories about Women in Public Art as a way to critically comprehend 
                        how common representations of the feminine is still affecting “real women” and their social frame. 
                        By doing this, the project additionally hopes to contribute to develop a broader understanding of the 
                        concepts of Public Art, City and Citizenship in present time.</p>

                    <p class="aboutparagraphs"> Therefore, Headless Women in Public Art is a mapping device that accommodates 
                      representations of Women in <a href="thewomen.html">four main categories</a> – Headless Women, Women Artists, Honored Women
                       and Non-Women – through the design of routes that include statues, monuments and sculptures. Right now, 
                       the map is focused in the design of routes in the city of <a href="routesporto.html">Porto, Portugal</a>, 
                       but aims to continue mapping the "headless women" in public art around the world. This map, with <a href="index.html">online</a> 
                       and <a href="fabric.html">fabric</a> versions, suggests walking tours that offer analytical perspectives on 
                       some of the Gender contradictions found in the Public Art of Porto. Inconsistencies that have become more visible 
                       with the social and political changes we are currently witnessing in the city. By using digital and live 
                       <a href="narratives.html">storytelling strategies</a>, the Headless Women in Public Art map provides an opportunity to learn from past and present representations 
                       of the feminine, highlighting the fundamental presence of Women in a city’s public sphere.</p>

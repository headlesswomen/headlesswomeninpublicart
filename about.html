                <p class="aboutparagraphs">The map of Headless Women in Public Art is part of the Headless Women and Other Events – 
                    a wider art and design project created by Mariana Morais which examines Public Art through women’s lens. 
                    This project aims to identify, reorganize, reflect and spatialize narratives related to Women. 
                    It promotes a diversification of histories about Women in Public Art as a way to critically comprehend 
                    how common representations of the feminine is still affecting “real women” and their social frame. 
                    By doing this, the project additionally hopes to contribute to develop a broader understanding of the 
                    concepts of Public Art, City and Citizenship in present time.</p>

                <p class="aboutparagraphs">Therefore, Headless Women in Public Art is a mapping device that accommodates 
                    representations of Women in four main categories – <a href="headlesswomen.html">Headless Women</a>, <a href="womenartists.html">Women Artists</a>, <a href="honoredwomen.html">Honored Women</a> 
                    and <a href="nonwomen.html">Non-Women</a> – through the design of <a href="map.html">routes</a> that include statues, 
                    monuments and sculptures. Right now, the map is focused in the design of routes in the city of <a href="routesporto.html" target="blank">Porto, Portugal</a>, 
                    but aims to continue mapping the "headless women" in public art around the world. This map, with online, paper and fabric 
                    versions, suggests walking tours that offer analytical perspectives on some of the Gender contradictions found 
                    in the Public Art of Porto. Inconsistencies that have become more visible with the social and political 
                    changes we are currently witnessing in the city. By using digital and live storytelling strategies, 
                    the Headless Women in Public Art map provides an opportunity to learn from past and present representations 
                    of the feminine, highlighting the fundamental presence of Women in a city’s public sphere.</p>

                <p class="paragraphs">The map of Headless Women in Public Art is part of the Headless Women and Other Events – 
                    a wider art and design project that examines Public Art in the city of Porto through women’s lens. 
                    This project aims to identify, reorganize, reflect and spatialize narratives related to Women. 
                    It promotes a diversification of histories about Women in Public Art as a way to critically comprehend 
                    how common representations of the feminine is still affecting “real women” and their social frame. 
                    By doing this, the project additionally hopes to contribute to develop a broader understanding of the 
                    concepts of Public Art, City and Citizenship in present time.</p>

                <p class="paragraphs">Therefore, Headless Women in Public Art is a mapping device that accommodates 
                    representations of Women in three main categories – “Women artist”, “Famous women” and “Non-women” – 
                    through the design of routes that include statues, monuments and sculptures in Porto’s public space. 
                    This map, with online, paper and fabric versions, suggests walking tours that offer analytical perspectives 
                    on some of the Gender contradictions found in the Public Art of Porto. Inconsistencies that have become more 
                    visible with the social and political changes we are currently witnessing in the city. By using digital 
                    and live storytelling strategies, the Headless Women in Public Art map provides an opportunity to learn 
                    from past and present representations of the feminine, highlighting the fundamental presence of Women in a 
                    city’s public sphere.</p>
